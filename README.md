# nerd-font-cheatsheets

Generated list of Nerd Font to simplify finding characters that look good in
text editors and terminal prompt.

## Usage

You'll need to pull the repo and open the files in your editor using a Nerd
Font-based font. Looking at the files in the browser will probably look goofy
with lots of missing glyphs.
